### instuction set 
fetch/execute cycle: fetch instuction from memory and execute.

### c notes:
c is extensively used to write compilers.
c standard - c89(Widely used)/c99/c11(Less used, latest)
c gives more freedom -> more responsibility.
main is the entry point of c programs.

### compile:
gcc filename -o executable.o

### compilation:
c code to machine instruction.
It has two steps:
1. preprocessing.
2. actual complation to generate machine code/object code.


### linking:
As name suggests its grabs all dependencies and creates a executable.
without -c option in gcc it does automatic linking.


###  Summary of c programs:
write -> compile -> link -> execute

### comments:
/*
multi line code
*/

// single line 

### preprocessor:
- compile time utility.
- used in constants. 
- including libraries.
- conditional preprocessor directives are supported.

### headers:
- function declaration is present usually.
- We hide the source code logic. Creating abstraction.
- We keep the main source in different file and header will have just function declaration.
- angular brackets: file present in standard c directories
- double quotes, it first check in current directory.

### variables /function imp:
declaire 
initialize (assign value)
definition (for functions)

### datatype modification  using type specifiers
short , long and unsigned.
short int -> uses less memory for int
long int -> more moremory than int
unsigned -> non negative values.
